# Exercise-5-Iris-Data

## Based on studies of the Iris flower by Ronald Fischer in 1936
# [IrisData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

# Exercise asked to 'Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.'


# Needed to count the characters in the row across so as to divide them up into columns. For example, the first column for Petal length had 3 characters(5.1), therefore needed to cpunt across 0 to 3 so as to include space. The second column then for Petal Width was after Peta; length, therefore was characters 4 to 7 to include a space also.
